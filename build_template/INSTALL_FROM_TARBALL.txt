How to Install AppGinger from a Binary Tarball
==============================================

The following instructions are a summary of the very simple 'install.sh'
script. All we do is unpack an archive in a suitable place.

1.  Download the binary-tarball ginger.tgz. Unpack it to
    extract these instructions, the license and the packed files
    'ginger-files.tgz'. 
        % cd /tmp
        % wget <GINGER_TARBALL_URL>/ginger.tgz
        % tar zxf ginger.tgz

2.  By default, Ginger will be installed in /usr/local. If you want to
    change this location edit install.sh and modify the INSTALL_DIR. 
        % cd ginger
        % vi install.sh

3.  Run the install.sh command as root
        % sudo sh install.sh

4.  You may delete the downloaded and unpacked files to save space.
        % rm /tmp/ginger.tgz 
        % rm -r /tmp/ginger
