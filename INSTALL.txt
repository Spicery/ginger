How to Install AppGinger
========================

There is not really any installation script as yet. You unpack and make the 
system.

* Unpack the appginger tarball into a local folder e.g. $INSTALL/appginger
* Change directory to that folder e.g. cd $INSTALL/appginger
* Make the binaries e.g. make

If all goes well you will find the $INSTALL/appginger/bin has two binaries

* appginger
* common2gnx

Update to Include Graham Higgin's Packaging Work
