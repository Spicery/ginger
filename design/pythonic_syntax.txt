01:19:10 Stephen Leach: Evening. Sort of *cough*
01:19:33 Graham Higgins : quite
01:22:24 Graham Higgins : very neat trick inverting the Python whitespace
01:23:01 Stephen Leach: Aye, it wasn't obvious
01:23:59 Stephen Leach: But as far as I can tell it gives you the key benefits of Python and (importantly) creates only a very small weakness for errors


01:39:45 Stephen Leach: So where in Python you might write this ...
01:40:38 Stephen Leach: def myMethod( self, a, b ): if self.test( a ) and self.test( b ): return self.compute( a, b ) else: return self.compute( b,a )
01:40:47 Stephen Leach: In Ginger you would write
01:41:42 Stephen Leach: def ^myMethod( a, b ) =>> compute( if ^test( a ) and ^test( b ) then a, b else b,a  endif ) enddefine
01:41:51 Stephen Leach: oops
01:41:59 Stephen Leach: def ^myMethod( a, b ) =>> ^compute( if ^test( a ) and ^test( b ) then a, b else b,a Â endif ) enddefine
01:42:11 Stephen Leach: And with the cute syntax ...
01:43:13 Graham Higgins : how universal is the ^ token, can it be used to reference attributes? ^foo, e.g.
01:43:33 Stephen Leach: 

def ^myMethod( a, b ):
    ^compute( 
        if ^test( a ) and ^test( b ):
            a, b 
        else: 
            b,a
    )
