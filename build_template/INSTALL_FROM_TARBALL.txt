How to Install AppGinger from a Binary Tarball
==============================================

The following instructions are a summary of the very simple 'install.sh'
script. All we do is unpack an archive in a suitable place.

1.  Download the binary-tarball AppGinger.tgz. Unpack it to
    extract these instructions, the license and the packed files
    'appginger-packed-files.tgz'. 

2.  Move the packed files to a temporary location e.g. /tmp. This
    is only done to keep the description in step 4 easy to explain.

3.  Change directory to where you want to install AppGinger. We
    suggest /usr/local. It will install the executables into the 
    'bin' directory and the support files into 'share/appginger'.
    The 'bin' directory should be on your $PATH.
        % cd /usr/local

4.  Unpack the appginger-files.tgz tarball. 
        % sudo tar zx /tmp/appginger-packed-files.tgz

5.  To check everything has installed as expected, run a check
    command. 
        % appginger-admin check-install
    You should see a confirmation message that everything is OK.

6.  You may delete the packed files archive to save space.
        % rm /tmp/appginger-packed-files.tgz
