The Ginger Toolchain
====================

Ginger is made up from a collection of simple program or ``tools'' that work nicely together. Typically the output from one tool is piped into the input of the next, so that the tools are linked in a chain. This is a common design in UNIX and a set of tools that works this way is called a ``toolchain''.
