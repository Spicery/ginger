Notes on the gngreadline Tool
=============================

Rather than try to integrate the GNU readline functionality directly into 
the Ginger interpreter, it make more sense to provide a separate readline
tool.

The aim is to provide a configurable tool that provides GNU readline
functionality and supports Ginger commands such as

	! UNIX_COMMAND
	help TOPIC_TAG*
