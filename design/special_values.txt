Special Values
==============

Ginger has several values which represent "no-result". 

The most useful one is -absent- which represents that there's no value that 
satisfies all the constraints.

The next most useful is -undefined- that represents an unconstrained value 
i.e. one that has not participated meaningfully in the constraint solving. 
Synonyms might be 'unknown' or 'unconstrained'. N.B. Alternative returns
are often a better way to manage pre-condition failure.

Less commonly useful is -indeterminate- that represents an under-constrained
solution, typically where a unique solution is required but many exist. N.B.
It might be a good idea to use alternative-returns to manage this.

The Values
----------

absent
~~~~~~
This value says that the code can find no more solutions. It is used to 
express the end of a sequence of values.

For example, one might write code to solve where a curve cuts the x-axis.
If the curve doesn't cut the x-axis it would be appropriate to return 
absent.

One might use absent to signal that an optional welcome message was missing.
This would be different from using the empty string - which would imply
a blank welcome message.

undefined
~~~~~~~~~
This value says that the code was supplied inputs for which there is no 
meaning (yet).

For example, one might write code to convert date-strings into Date objects.
If the date-string was not a recognised format then one could return 
undefined to represent an explicit failure value. [Actually we would prefer
to make an alternative return - but I haven't implemented that yet.]

One also might use undefined as an initial value for variables in a sequence
of code that incrementally constrains their values.

indeterminate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This value says that there are many solutions, all in some sense unsatisfactory.



The Differences
---------------
What is the difference between undefined and absent? Undefined represents
the lack of constraints whereas absent represents an excess of constraints.

Undefined and interdeterminate are similar. But undefined says that some
pre-condition on the inputs has not been met. Indeterminate says that there
are solutions-of-a-kind but they lack a required quality (normally uniqueness).

* Undefined:: constraints not applied.
* Indeterminate:: under constrained, many/inadequate solutions.
* Absent:: over constrained, no solution.
