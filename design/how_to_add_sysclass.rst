How to Add a System Class
=========================

I decided to write these notes up when I found myself puzzling over how to add the sysclass DynamicVector.

There are three stages. 

	1.	We need a runtime constant. In this case sysDynamicVectorKey.
	2.	Next we need to make the Code Generator recognise the expression
		<constant type="sysclass" value="DynamicVector"/>
	3.	We need to have a constant added to the standard library.

Runtime Constant
----------------
The script ${GINGER_DEV_SRC}/apps/automatic/simple/make_simple.py is responsible for generating the relevant C++ code. 

All simple keys are declared here. This is the right place to declare the simple keys of the GVM.

Code Generator
--------------
The method CodeGenClass\:\:calcConstant is responsible for interpreting the meaning of all <constant> elements. 

I replaced some hand-written code that recognised sysclasses on a case-by-case basis with some automatically generated code generated by make_simple.py. So no changes here should be required.

Adding to the Standard Library
------------------------------
You'll need to modify the script ${GINGER_DEV_SRC}/projects/make_standard_library.py so that it includes the constant you want added to the library.
