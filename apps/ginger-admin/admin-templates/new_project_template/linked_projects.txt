#	(Edit this file as you see fit)
#
#	This file lists additional project folders that you want automatically
#	added to the project search-path. You can use this to make available
#	any libraries your code depends on - or simply to ensure that your
#	favourite libraries are to hand.
#
#	Blank lines and lines that starts with a '#' symbol are ignored. Otherwise
#	you should add the pathname of each project folder on its own line. You 
#	may use environment variables and '~' to define paths.
#
#	Note that relative pathnames are treated as relative to the current 
#	project, i.e. the folder enclosing this file, and not your working 
#	directory.

#	You don't need to add the standard library to the search path. But 
#	if you did you would add a line like this (but without the leading #).
#	There's no need to include a trailing slash, although it does no harm.
#/usr/local/share/ginger/standard_library

#	You can use environment variables. e.g.
#${GINGERLIBS}/my_useful_project

#	And you can use relative pathnames, relative to this project folder.
#../my_sister_project

#	Or you can use '~' to refer to your home directory or the home directory
#	of other users.
#~/Documents/GingerProjects
