Supported Platforms for Ginger
==============================

Unix
----

Ginger is designed as a FOSS UNIX tool, to be run in a UNIX toolchain. Priority is given to FOSS systems. 

  * Linux
  * Mac OS X
  * Cygwin (not tested for a year but did compile pretty easily)

What about Free BSD?
--------------------

It should be in the list. I simply don't have a Free BSD setup. I hope someone will pick this one up early.

What about native Windows?
--------------------------

When we get around to doing the Ginger IDE, we'll pick up a cross-platform GUI like wxWindows or Qt. At that point it'll be worth taking a serious look at whether or not we can make Ginger properly cross-platform. Until then, Cygwin will be the way to go.
