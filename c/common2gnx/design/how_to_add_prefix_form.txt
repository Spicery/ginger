How to Add a Prefix Form to common2gnx
======================================

Overview
--------
These notes are based on what I did to add the keyword "package".

Steps
-----

1.	If required add elements and attributes to the Ginger XML
	syntax. At present, this is done by editing the document 
	ginger_xml_syntax.txt
	
	In this case we added the element
		<package url=URL/>
	This is obviously incomplete since it does not include
	imports. Those will get added in a separate development step.
	
2.	Add all the tokens that the syntax needs. For every new keyword 
	this means modifying
	
		a.	toktype.hpp - to add a new case to the enum tokType
		b.	toktype.hpp - to add the enum to new tok_type_name
		c.	item_map.cpp - where the attributes of the token are set

	Only the last part (c) is tricky. You need to specify 
	
		* 	the external name of the token ("package")
		* 	the internal enum (tokty_package)
		*	the 'role' of the token (PrefixRole)
		*	the precedence, if it can appear in a postfix context
			(it can't, leave at 0)
			
	For more details see "how_to_add_keywords.txt".

3.	Add a new case to ReadStateClass::prefix_processing() in
	"read_expr.cpp". Note that this case must end with a return and
	not a break.
