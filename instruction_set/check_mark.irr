	CHECK_MARK LOCAL_N COUNT
	where
		LOCAL_N : long
		COUNT	: long

Code
    <check.mark local=LOCAL_N count=COUNT />

Summary
	Checks that the number of items on the stack since the local
	LOCAL_N was recorded is exactly COUNT.
	
Unchecked Precondition
	Pointer values are long-aligned and hence masquerade as Smalls
	as far as the garbage collector is concerned.
	
Exceptions (Checked Preconditions)
	The difference between the two pointers LOCAL[n] & VMVP isn't N.
	
Result (Postcondition)		
	It is confirmed that no values were pushed on the stack.
