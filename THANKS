Thanks to everyone who has commented and contributed to the Ginger virtual
machine project over the many years we have been running. In particular it is
a pleasure to acknowledge the long standing support and willingness to
share their insights of the Spice group - that is Chris Dollin, Kevin Rogers, 
Luc Beaudoin and Graham Higgins. 

Also a special thank you goes to Dave Raggett who sparked this work with his
suggestion that we needed to design a better stylesheet language - we'll get
there one day!
