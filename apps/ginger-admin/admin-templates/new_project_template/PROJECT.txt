Ginger Project Folder
=====================

This folder is used to store a Ginger 'project'. Projects are collections
of software that you and other people write. When the Ginger virtual machine
starts up, it will be given a search-list of project folders in which to
look for definitions.

If one project depends on another, then you can arrange that the dependencies
are automatically included on the search-path. This is done by creating a
file 

	linked_projects.txt

at the top-level of the project directory. The lines are read one by one,
ignoring any comment-lines starting with '#', and these folders are added
to the project search-list.

If you create a project using the ginger-admin command, a linked_projects.txt
file is automatically created for you with some helpful comments inside.
