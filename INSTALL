Installing the Ginger Virtual Machine
=====================================

Introduction
------------
This note describes how to install the Ginger Virtual Machine from source
onto a bare machine.

Installing on Ubuntu (from the command-line)
--------------------------------------------

*	Pre-requisites: you'll need 
		git, python, g++, autoconf
	You can ensure you have these in one step with
		% sudo apt-get git python g++ autoconf

*	TODO: rudecgi
		% mkdir /tmp/rudecgi
		% cd /tmp/rudecgi
		% wget http://www.rudeserver.com/cgiparser/download/rudecgi-5.0.0.tar.gz

*	Create a Spicery folder for ginger and any sister projects. e.g.
		% GINGER_HOME=~/Spicery
		% mkdir $GINGER_HOME
		% cd $GINGER_HOME

*	Clone from the GitHub repository into a folder.
		% git clone https://github.com/Spicery/ginger.git

Installing onto Mac OS X
------------------------



* Unpack the Ginger tarball into a local folder $APPGINGER.

	$ GINGER_HOME=~/ginger
	$ mkdir $APPGINGER
	$ tar zxf appginger.tgz

* Change directory to that folder.

	$ cd $APPGINGER

* Run configure	and make

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	
If all goes well you will find the $APPGINGER/bin folder has two executables

	* appginger
